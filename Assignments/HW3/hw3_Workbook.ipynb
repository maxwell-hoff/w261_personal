    "## HW 3 - Synonym Detection In Spark\n",
    "__`MIDS w261: Machine Learning at Scale | UC Berkeley School of Information | Summer 2022`__\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last homework assignment you performed Naive Bayes to classify documents as 'ham' or 'spam.' In doing so, we relied on the implicit assumption that the list of words in a document can tell us something about the nature of that document's content. We'll rely on a similar intuition this week: the idea that, if we analyze a large enough corpus of text, the list of words that appear in small window before or after a vocabulary term can tell us something about that term's meaning. This is similar to the intuition behind the word2vec algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be your first assignment working in Spark. You'll perform Synonym Detection by repurposing an algorithm commonly used in Natural Language Processing to perform document similarity analysis. In doing so you'll also become familiar with important datatypes for efficiently processing sparse vectors and a number of set similarity metrics (e.g. Cosine, Jaccard, Dice). By the end of this homework you should be able to:  \n",
    "* ... __define__ the terms `one-hot encoding`, `co-occurrence matrix`, `stripe`, `inverted index`, `postings`, and `basis vocabulary` in the context of both synonym detection and document similarity analysis.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ the reasoning behind using a word stripe to compare word meanings.\n",
    "* ... __identify__ what makes set-similarity calculations computationally challenging.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ stateless algorithms in Spark to build stripes, inverted index and compute similarity metrics.\n",
    "* ... __identify__ when it makes sense to take a stripe approach and when to use pairs\n",
    "* ... __apply__ appropriate metrics to assess the performance of your synonym detection algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "__RECOMMENDED READING FOR HW3__:\t\n",
    "Your reading assignment for weeks 4 and 5 were fairly heavy and you may have glossed over the papers on dimension independent similarity metrics by [Zadeh et al](http://stanford.edu/~rezab/papers/disco.pdf) and pairwise document similarity by [Elsayed et al](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~oard/pdf/acl08elsayed2.pdf). If you haven't already, this would be a good time to review those readings, especially when it comes to the similarity formulas -- they are directly relevant to this assignment.\n",

    "# Question 3: Synonym Detection Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Synonym Detection task we want to compare the meaning of words, not documents. For clarity, lets call the words whose meaning we want to compare `terms`. If only we had a 'meaning document' for each `term` then we could easily use the document similarity strategy from Question 2 to figure out which `terms` have similar meaning (i.e. are 'synonyms'). Of course in order for that to work we'd have to reasonably believe that the words in these 'meaning documents' really do reflect the meaning of the `term`. For a good analysis we'd also need these 'meaning documents' to be fairly long -- the one or two sentence dictionary definition of a term isn't going to provide enough signal to distinguish between thousands and thousands of `term` meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the idea of co-occurrence comes in. Just like DocSim makes the assumption that words in a document tell us about the document's meaning, we're going to assume that the set of words that 'co-occur' within a small window around our term can tell us some thing about the meaning of that `term`. Remember that we're going to make this 'co-words' list (a.k.a. 'stripe') by looking at a large body of text. This stripe is our 'meaning document' in that it reflects all the kinds of situations in which our `term` gets used in real language. So another way to phrase our assumption is: we think `terms` that get used to complete lots of the same phrases probably have related meanings. This may seem like an odd assumption but computational linguists have found that it works surprisingly well in practice. Let's look at a toy example to build your intuition for why and how.\n",

    "# Question 4: Pairs and Stripes at Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "As you read in the paper by [Zadeh et al](http://stanford.edu/~rezab/papers/disco.pdf), the advantage of metrics like Cosine, Dice, Overlap and Jaccard is that they are dimension independent -- that is to say, if we implement them in a smart way the computational complexity of performing these computations is independent of the number of documents we want to compare (or in our case, the number of terms that are potential synonyms). One component of a 'smart implementation' involves thinking carefully both about how you define the \"basis vocabulary\" that forms your feature set (removing stopwords, etc). Another key idea is to use a data structure that facilitates distributed calculations. The DISCO (Dimension Independent Similarity Computation) implementation further uses a sampling strategy, but that is beyond the scope of this assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question we'll take a closer look at the computational complexity of the synonym detection approach we took in question 3 and then revisit the document similarity example as a way to explore a more efficient approach to parallelizing this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4 Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __a) multiple choice (choose 2):__ In question 3 you calculated the cosine similarity of pairs of words using the vector representation of their co-occurrences in a corpus. In the async videos about \"Pairs and Stripes\" you were introduced to an alternative strategy. Explain two ways that using these data structures are more efficient than 1-hot encoded vectors when it comes to distributed similarity calculations [__`HINT:`__ _Consider memory constraints, amount of information being shuffled, amount of information being transfered over the network, and level of parallelization._]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) read provided code:__ The code below provides a streamined implementation of Document similarity analysis in Spark. Read through this code carefully. Once you are confident you understand how it works, answer the remaining questions. [__`TIP:`__ _to see the output of each transformation try commenting out the subsequent lines and adding an early `collect()` action_.]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ The second mapper function, `splitWords`, emits 'postings'. The list of all 'postings' for a word is also refered to as an 'inverted index'. In your own words, define each of these terms ('postings' and 'inverted index') based on your reading of the provided code. (*DITP by Lin and Dyer also contains a chapter on the Inverted Index although in the context of Hadoop rather than Spark. You may find the illustration in Chaprter 4 helpful in answering this question*).\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ The third mapper, `makeCompositeKeys`, loops over the inverted index to emit 'pairs' of what? Explain what information is included in the composite key created at this stage and why it makes sense to synchronize around that information in the context of performing document similarity calculations. In addition to the information included in these new keys, what other piece of information will we need to compute Jaccard or Cosine similarity?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) multiple choice:__ Out of all the Spark transformations we make in this analysis, which are 'wide' transformations and which are 'narrow' transformations, and why?"

    "Stripes are efficient because they can be stored as Python dicts, which are very efficient data structures.\n",
    "Stripes allow us to track the same information as full vectors/matrices with less memory overhead because we don't encode zeros.\n",
    "? Pairs allow us to compute counts needed for the DISCO metrics without doing an explicit vector computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ _read provided code before answering d-e_ \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ An inverted index is a method of storing counts by term in dictionary form. The term is the key value, and they values for each key are the counts per document that the term appears in. These values are called postings, and act as a dictionary within a dictionary.  The keys are the documents that the term appears in, and the values for each of these keys are the number of times the term appears within that document.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ The mapper makeCompositeKeys emits pairs of possible document combinations that a word can be in. For example, one key can be for terms that appear in both document A and document B.  It makes sense to synchronize around this information since these term intersections can be used within certain similarity metrics that leverage unions of terms between documents. For Jaccard similarity, the only piece of information that is missing is the total count of documents that a term appears in. For cosine similarity, the missing piece of information is the norm of each term.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ The map() and three flatMap()s are wide because they can operate on any part of the data regardless of partitioning. The reduceByKey()s are narrow transformations, because they \"narrow\" the data by aggregating it."

    "Now that you are comfortable with similarity metrics we turn to the main task in this assignment: \"Synonym\" Detection. As you saw in Question 3 the ability of our algorithm to detect words with similar meanings is highly dependent on our input text. Specifically, we need a large enough corpus of natural language that we can expose our algorithm to a realistic range of contexts in which any given word might get used. Ideally, these 'contexts' would also provide enough signal to distinguish between words with similar semantic roles but different meaning. Finding such a corpus will be easier to accomplish for some words than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the main task in this portion of the homework you will use data from Google's n-gram corpus. This data is particularly convenient for our task because Google has already done the first step for us: they windowed over a large subset of the web and extracted all 5-grams. If you are interested in learning more about this dataset the original source is: http://books.google.com/ngrams/, and a large subset is available [here from AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/datasets/google-books-ngrams/). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we have provided a subset of the 5-grams data consisting of 191 files of approximately 10MB each. These files are available in the 'data' folder in 'Assignments/HW3/' github. Please only use the provided data so that we can ensure consistent results from student to student.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in our dataset represents one of these 5 grams in the format:\n",
    "> `(ngram) \\t (count) \\t (pages_count) \\t (books_count)`\n",
    "\n",
    "__DISCLAIMER__: In real life, we would calculate the stripes cooccurrence data from the raw text by windowing over the raw text and not from the 5-gram preprocessed data.  Calculating pairs on this 5-gram is a little corrupt as we will be double counting cooccurences. Having said that this exercise can still pull out some similar terms."

    "Every word that appears in our data is a potential feature for our synonym detection analysis. However as we've discussed, some are likely to be more useful than others. In this question, you'll choose a judicious subset of these words to form our 'basis vocabulary'. Practically speaking, this means that when we build our stripes, we are only going to keep track of when a term co-occurs with one of these basis words. \n",

    "* __a1) multiple choice:__ Suppose we were deciding between two different basis vocabularies: the 1000 most frequent words or the 1000 least frequent words. How would this choice impact the quality of the synonyms we are able to detect? How does this choice relate to the ideas of 'overfitting' or 'underfitting' a training set?\n",

    "* __a2) short response:__Explain your answer above\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ If we had a much larger dataset, computing the full ordered list of words would be extremely expensive. If we need to none-the-less get an estimate of word frequency in order to decide on a basis vocabulary, what alternative strategy could we take?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) multiple choice:__ Run the provided spark job that does the following:\n",
    "  * tokenizes, removes stopwords and computes a word count on the ngram data\n",
    "  * subsets the top 10,000 words (these are the terms we'll consider as potential synonyms)\n",
    "  * subsets words 9,000-9,999 (this will be our 1,000 word basis vocabulary)    \n",
    "  (to put it another way - of the top 10,000 words, the bottom 1,000 form the basis vocabulary)\n",
    "  * saves the full 10K word list and the 1K basis vocabulary to file for use in `d`.  \n",

    "* __d) code:__ Write a spark job that builds co-occurrence stripes for the top 10K words in the ngram data using the basis vocabulary you developed in `part c`. This job/function, unlike others so far, should return an RDD (which we will then use in q8)."
