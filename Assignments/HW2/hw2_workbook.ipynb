    "In the live sessions for week 2 and week 3 you got some practice designing and debugging Hadoop Streaming jobs. In this homework we'll use Hadoop MapReduce to implement your first parallelized machine learning algorithm: Naive Bayes. As you develop your implementation you'll test it on a small dataset that matches the 'Chinese Example' in the _Manning, Raghavan and Shutze_ reading for Week 2. For the main task in this assignment you'll be working with a small subset of the Enron Spam/Ham Corpus. By the end of this assignment you should be able to:\n",

    "### Q1 Student Answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> __a)__ Hadoop Mapreduce is based off of the the functional programming paradigm. The main ideas of functional programming is that each tasks are executed sequentially. MapReduce exemplifies this since there are several stages within a MapReduce job, each of them being executed after another stage is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ The shuffle is the step between the map phase and the reduce phase. It takes the outputs from the map stage, and sorts the results so they can be reduced. It is potentially costly because it has to iterate through every observation within your dataset and place it a pre-defined order. Iterating through every observation is a potentially costly computation. One step we can take to reduce this cost is to pre-shuffle and combine our observations within each partition of the map phase, also called a combiner. This reduces the cost since you are reducing the number of records that you iterate over.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ Input and output records of a combiner script have to be the same because a reducer expects to receive as an input the output of the map stage. Because of this, a combiner has to act like it is an output a mapper, and since the input of a combiner is a mapper, it needs to produce an output of the same format.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ 1. You can control the number of partitions that are parallelized within a Hadoop Streaming job, but you can't control whether each of the parallelized tasks are completed at the same pace. Some partitions may be more computational costly compared to other partitions, due to differences in the data within the partitions. On top of this, some partitions may be computed on faster, more reliable machines, resulting in uneven completion times. Because of these issues, you need to be careful about the sequencing of jobs within a Hadoop Stream. You can mitigate these factors by adding in parameters that wait until all partitions are completed before moving on to the next phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ Networked computing clusters prompted the creation of parallel computation frameworks, since having the capability to scale computations across a network of computers could speed up calculations linearally to the number of computers in the cluster."

Ideally, we should be able to define an arbirtary number of splits and still get the right result, but that is not always possible. Parallelization becomes particularly challenging when we need to make comparisons between records, for example when sorting. Total Order Sort allows us to order large datasets in a way that enables efficient retrieval of results. Before beginning this assignment, make sure you have read and understand the [Total Order Sort Notebook](https://github.com/UCB-w261/main/tree/master/HelpfulResources/TotalSortGuide/_total-sort-guide-spark2.01-JAN27-2017.ipynb).

In order of appearce, they are count of times of appearence within each of the classes (spam and not spam), and then the conditional probability for that word for each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The record that is slightly different is the ClassPriors records, which acts somewhat as a total row. The values within this record are; number of records for each class, and then the class prior of each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The two fields within each record that we don't necessarily need for modeling are the counts of each word within each class. These are used to calculate the conditional probabilities, and will be useful for debugging since conditional probabilities are tougher to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ We choose to work with adding log probabilities instead of multiplying, since the multiplying probabilities may results in numbers that are too small to store in memory, also known as floating point underflow, results in incorrect calculations. One downside for this transformation is that if you don't smooth your model, you calculation may result in undefined if there is probability of zero, since the log of zero is undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ At inference time, these two words should be ignored, since they do not have a probability associated with either class, and there is no harm caused by dropping them from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ Loading a model state into memory is a departure from functional programming, since you are moving beyond a string of functions, and loading a function that has been pre-calculated/trained. This approach most likely would not scale well if the corpus gets large enough. Say you have a corpus the size of the english language, and you join that against each partition, you are most likely going to get an \"out of memory\" error. Clever ways of partioning your corpus/joins most likely will allow you to circumvent this issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ Complete the coding portion of this question before answering 'f'.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __f)__ If we switch to an algorithm with higher levels of parallelization, one of the main changes we'd have to make is it switch the class prediction to the reducer, after results have been aggregated. This is because you wouldn't have the full corpus to decide whether the probability of one class is higher than the other. The mappers could still begin aggregating log probabilities for words within the document, you just couldn't choose a predicted class until the reducer phase. For the reducer to work, the key-value output of the mapper would have to be docID, class, and then aggregated log probabilites for both classes. The reducer would then combine the log probabilites for each docID-class combination."

    "# Question 8: Naive Bayes Training.\n",
    "In Question 7 we used a model that we had trained by hand. Next we'll develop the code to do that same training in parallel, making it suitable for use with larger corpora (like the Enron emails). The end result of the MapReduce job you write in this question should be a model text file that looks just like the example (`NBmodel.txt`) that we created by hand above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refresh your memory about the training process take a look at  `6a` and `6b` where you described the pieces of information you'll need to collect in order to encode a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. We now want to retrieve those pieces of information while streaming over a corpus. The bulk of the task will be very similar to the word counting excercises you've already done but you may want to consider a slightly different key-value record structure to efficiently tally counts for each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging (interesting?) design question will be how to retrieve the totals (# of documents and # of words in documents for each class). Of course, counting these numbers is easy. The hard part is the timing: you'll need to make sure you have the counts totalled up _before_ you start estimating the class conditional probabilities for each word. It would be best (i.e. most scalable) if we could find a way to do this tallying without storing the whole vocabulary in memory... Use an appropriate MapReduce design pattern to implement this efficiently! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) make a plan:__  Fill in the docstrings for __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ to appropriately reflect the format that each script will input/output. [`HINT:` _the input files_ (`enronemail_1h.txt` & `chineseTrain.txt`) _have a prespecified format and your output file should match_ `NBmodel.txt` _so you really only have to decide on an internal format for Hadoop_].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) implement it:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ so that together they train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model __with no smoothing__. Make sure your end result is formatted correctly (see note above). Test your scripts independently and together (using `chineseTrain.txt` or test input of your own devising). When you are satisfied with your Python code design and run a Hadoop streaming command to run your job in parallel on the __chineseTrain.txt__. Confirm that your trained model matches your hand calculations from Question 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ We saw in Question 6 that adding Laplace smoothing (where the smoothing parameter $k=1$) makes our classifications less sensitve to rare words. However implementing this technique requires access to one additional piece of information that we had not previously used in our Naive Bayes training. What is that extra piece of information? [`HINT:` see equation 13.7 in Manning, Raghavan and Schutze].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ There are a couple of approaches that we could take to handle the extra piece of information you identified in `c`: 1) if we knew this extra information beforehand, we could provide it to our reducer as a configurable parameter for the vocab size dynamically (_where would we get it in the first place?_). Or 2) we could compute it in the reducer without storing any bulky information in memory but then we'd need some postprocessing or a second MapReduce job to complete the calculation (_why?_). Breifly explain what is non-ideal about each of these options. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code + short response:__ Choose one of the 2 options above. State your choice & reasoning in the space below then use that strategy to complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer_smooth.py`__. Test this alternate reducer then write and run a Hadoop streaming job to train an MNB model with smoothing on the Chinese example. Your results should match the model that we provided for you above (and the calculations in the textbook example). __IMPORTANT NOTE:__ For full credit on this question, your code must work with multiple reducers. \n",

    "### Q9 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) train/test split:__ Run the provided code to split our Enron file into a training set and testing set then load them into HDFS. [`NOTE:` _Make sure you re calculate the vocab size for just the training set!_]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) train 2 models:__ Write Hadoop Streaming jobs to train MNB Models on the training set with and without smoothing. Save your models to local files at __`NaiveBayes/Unsmoothed/NBmodel.txt`__ and __`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.txt`__. [`NOTE:` _This naming is important because we wrote our classification task so that it expects a file of that name... if this inelegance frustrates you there is an alternative that would involve a few adjustments to your code [read more about it here](http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-11-23)._] Finally run the checks that we provide to confirm that your results are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Recall that we designed our classification job with just a mapper. An efficient way to report the performance of our models would be to simply add a reducer phase to this job and compute precision and recall right there. Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/evaluation_reducer.py`__ and then write Hadoop jobs to evaluate your two models on the test set. Report their performance side by side. [`NOTE:` if you need a refresher on precision, recall and F1-score [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) is a good resource.]\n",

    "* __a) code + short response:__ Let's look at the top ten words with the highest conditional probability in `Spam` and in `Ham`. We'll do this by writing a Hadoop job that sorts the model file (`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.py`). Normally we'd have to run two jobs -- one that sorts on $P(word|ham)$ and another that sorts on $P(word|spam)$. However if we slighly modify the data format in the model file then we can get the top words in each class with just one job. We've written a mapper that will do just this for you. Read through __`NaiveBayes/model_sort_mapper.py`__ and then briefly explain how this mapper will allow us to partition and sort our model file. Write a Hadoop job that uses our mapper and `/bin/cat` for a reducer to partition and sort. Print out the top 10 words in each class (where 'top' == highest conditional probability).[`HINT:` _this should remind you a lot of what we did in Question 6._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ What do you notice about the 'top words' we printed in `a`? How would increasing the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the probabilities for the top words that you identified for 'a'. How would they affect the probabilities of words that occur much more in one class than another? In summary, how does the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the bias and the variance of our model. [`NOTE:` _you do not need to code anything for this task, but if you are struggling with it you could try changing 'k' and see what happens to the test set. We don't recommend doing this exploration with the Enron data because it will be harder to see the impact with such a big vocabulary_]"
