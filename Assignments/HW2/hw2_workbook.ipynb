For the main task in this assignment you'll be working with a small subset of the Enron Spam/Ham Corpus. By the end of this assignment you should be able to:\n",

    "### Q1 Student Answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> __a)__ Hadoop Mapreduce is based off of the the functional programming paradigm. The main ideas of functional programming is that each tasks are executed sequentially. MapReduce exemplifies this since there are several stages within a MapReduce job, each of them being executed after another stage is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ The shuffle is the step between the map phase and the reduce phase. It takes the outputs from the map stage, and sorts the results so they can be reduced. It is potentially costly because it has to iterate through every observation within your dataset and place it a pre-defined order. Iterating through every observation is a potentially costly computation. One step we can take to reduce this cost is to pre-shuffle and combine our observations within each partition of the map phase, also called a combiner. This reduces the cost since you are reducing the number of records that you iterate over.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ Input and output records of a combiner script have to be the same because a reducer expects to receive as an input the output of the map stage. Because of this, a combiner has to act like it is an output a mapper, and since the input of a combiner is a mapper, it needs to produce an output of the same format.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ 1. You can control the number of partitions that are parallelized within a Hadoop Streaming job, but you can't control whether each of the parallelized tasks are completed at the same pace. Some partitions may be more computational costly compared to other partitions, due to differences in the data within the partitions. On top of this, some partitions may be computed on faster, more reliable machines, resulting in uneven completion times. Because of these issues, you need to be careful about the sequencing of jobs within a Hadoop Stream. You can mitigate these factors by adding in parameters that wait until all partitions are completed before moving on to the next phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ Networked computing clusters prompted the creation of parallel computation frameworks, since having the capability to scale computations across a network of computers could speed up calculations linearally to the number of computers in the cluster."

Ideally, we should be able to define an arbirtary number of splits and still get the right result, but that is not always possible. Parallelization becomes particularly challenging when we need to make comparisons between records, for example when sorting. Total Order Sort allows us to order large datasets in a way that enables efficient retrieval of results. Before beginning this assignment, make sure you have read and understand the [Total Order Sort Notebook](https://github.com/UCB-w261/main/tree/master/HelpfulResources/TotalSortGuide/_total-sort-guide-spark2.01-JAN27-2017.ipynb). You can skip the first two MRJob sections, but the rest of section III and all of section IV are **very** important (and apply to Hadoop Streaming) so make sure to read them closely.

    "> __b)__ We choose to work with adding log probabilities instead of multiplying, since the multiplying probabilities may results in numbers that are too small to store in memory, also known as floating point underflow, results in incorrect calculations. One downside for this transformation is that if you don't smooth your model, you calculation may result in undefined if there is probability of zero, since the log of zero is undefined.\n",

This approach most likely would not scale well if the corpus gets large enough. Say you have a corpus the size of the english language, and you join that against each partition, you are most likely going to get an \"out of memory\" error. Clever ways of partioning your corpus/joins most likely will allow you to circumvent this issue. \n",

    "> __f)__ If we switch to an algorithm with higher levels of parallelization, one of the main changes we'd have to make is it switch the class prediction to the reducer, after results have been aggregated. This is because you wouldn't have the full corpus to decide whether the probability of one class is higher than the other. The mappers could still begin aggregating log probabilities for words within the document, you just couldn't choose a predicted class until the reducer phase. For the reducer to work, the key-value output of the mapper would have to be docID, class, and then aggregated log probabilites for both classes. The reducer would then combine the log probabilites for each docID-class combination."

The bulk of the task will be very similar to the word counting excercises you've already done but you may want to consider a slightly different key-value record structure to efficiently tally counts for each class. \n",

Make sure your end result is formatted correctly (see note above). Test your scripts independently and together (using `chineseTrain.txt` or test input of your own devising).

[`HINT:` see equation 13.7 in Manning, Raghavan and Schutze].\n",

Or 2) we could compute it in the reducer without storing any bulky information in memory but then we'd need some postprocessing or a second MapReduce job to complete the calculation (_why?_). Breifly explain what is non-ideal about each of these options. \n",

    "* __e) code + short response:__ Choose one of the 2 options above. State your choice & reasoning in the space below then use that strategy to complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer_smooth.py`__. Test this alternate reducer then write and run a Hadoop streaming job to train an MNB model with smoothing on the Chinese example. Your results should match the model that we provided for you above (and the calculations in the textbook example). __IMPORTANT NOTE:__ For full credit on this question, your code must work with multiple reducers. \n",

    "* __a) train/test split:__ Run the provided code to split our Enron file into a training set and testing set then load them into HDFS. [`NOTE:` _Make sure you re calculate the vocab size for just the training set!_]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) train 2 models:__ Write Hadoop Streaming jobs to train MNB Models on the training set with and without smoothing. Save your models to local files at __`NaiveBayes/Unsmoothed/NBmodel.txt`__ and __`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.txt`__. [`NOTE:` _This naming is important because we wrote our classification task so that it expects a file of that name... if this inelegance frustrates you there is an alternative that would involve a few adjustments to your code [read more about it here](http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-11-23)._] Finally run the checks that we provide to confirm that your results are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Recall that we designed our classification job with just a mapper. An efficient way to report the performance of our models would be to simply add a reducer phase to this job and compute precision and recall right there. Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/evaluation_reducer.py`__ and then write Hadoop jobs to evaluate your two models on the test set. Report their performance side by side. [`NOTE:` if you need a refresher on precision, recall and F1-score [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) is a good resource.]\n",

We'll do this by writing a Hadoop job that sorts the model file (`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.py`). Normally we'd have to run two jobs -- one that sorts on $P(word|ham)$ and another that sorts on $P(word|spam)$. However if we slighly modify the data format in the model file then we can get the top words in each class with just one job. We've written a mapper that will do just this for you. Read through __`NaiveBayes/model_sort_mapper.py`__ and then briefly explain how this mapper will allow us to partition and sort our model file. Write a Hadoop job that uses our mapper and `/bin/cat` for a reducer to partition and sort. Print out the top 10 words in each class (where 'top' == highest conditional probability).[`HINT:` _this should remind you a lot of what we did in Question 6._]\n",

    "* __b) short response:__ What do you notice about the 'top words' we printed in `a`? How would increasing the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the probabilities for the top words that you identified for 'a'. How would they affect the probabilities of words that occur much more in one class than another? In summary, how does the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the bias and the variance of our model. [`NOTE:` _you do not need to code anything for this task, but if you are struggling with it you could try changing 'k' and see what happens to the test set. We don't recommend doing this exploration with the Enron data because it will be harder to see the impact with such a big vocabulary_]"
