# Homework 1: Intro to the Map Reduce Paradigm

This first assignment is designed to introduce you to the Map Reduce paradigm and a few key skills you will need in subsequent assignments. Your work consists of 9 questions in **`hw1_Workbook.ipynb`**. Some of the items will instruct you to make modifications to the supplemental files we have provided. Please be sure to read all docstrings and inline comments closely. We will only grade code written in the designated spaces. If a question's instructions are unclear, please reach out for clarification on Slack. We expect each student to write their own code but collaboration without code sharing is encouraged.

### How to submit your work:

To complete the Homework 1 assignment you will need to submit your responses on <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/4745907/quizzes/10968093">the Canvas assignment form here</a>.

We **strongly recommend** completing and saving all responses in the Homework 1 notebook first before attempting to submit the assignment in Canvas, because:

1) All responses in Canvas must be submitted at once (i.e. on Canvas you can't save a half-completed assignment and come back later).
2) For full marks you will be required to upload an HTML and .ipynb version of your notebooks on the Canvas form, so it will need to be completed before submission.

### Tips:
* Make use of your peers and TAs by asking questions on Slack. Everyone comes to MIDs from a different background so don't be shy; all questions are welcome!
