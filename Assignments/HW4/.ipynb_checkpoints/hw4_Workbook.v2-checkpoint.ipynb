    "__`MIDS w261: Machine Learning at Scale | UC Berkeley School of Information | Summer 2022`__\n",
    "\n",
    "HW4 is composed of two sections (see module 6 for access to the HW4 sections):\n",
    "\n",
    "* A timed quiz (20 questions) with all questions available in Canvas only. You will need a Spark cluster to complete the questions. You will get three attempts to complete this quiz and you will get some feedback after each attempt. \n",
    "* A regular assignment in the form of a Jupyter notebook and Canvas quiz with no immediate feedback upon submission. \n",
    "NOTE: both parts will be graded and will contribute to your overall grade for the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook and Canvas quiz forms part 2 of 2 for HW4.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first three HW assignments, you became familiar with the Map-Reduce programming paradigm as manifested in the Hadoop Streaming and Spark frameworks. We explored how different data structures and design patterns can help us manage the computational complexity of an algorithm. As part of this process you implemented both a supervised learning algorithm (Naive Bayes) and an unsupervised learning algorithm (synonym detection via cosine similarity). In both of these tasks parallelization helped us manage calculations involving a large number of features. However a large feature space isn't the only situation that might prompt us to want to parallelize a machine learning algorithm. In the final two assignments we'll look at cases where the iterative nature of an algorithm is the main driver of its computational complexity (and the reason we might want to parallelize it).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will learn linear models using different loss functions: OLS, RidgeMSE, LassoMSE, BXE, CXE, RidgeBXE, LASSOBXE, etc.. As in previous assignments, you will implement the core calculations using Spark RDDs... though we've provided more of a code base than before since the focus of the latter half of the course is more on general machine learning concepts. By the end of this homework you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ... __define__ the loss functions for linear regression and linear classifier models OLS, RidgeMSE, LassoMSE, BXE, CXE, RidgeBXE, LASSOBXE, etc.\n",
    "* ... __calculate__ the gradient for each of these loss functions.\n",
    "* ... __identify__ which parts of the gradient descent algorithm can be parallelized.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ parallelized gradient descent with cross-validation and regularization.\n",
    "* ... __compare/contrast__ how L1 and L2 regularization impact model parameters & performance.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Question 2: EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistician's approach to Linear Regression typically involves a series of EDA steps to examine each feature in the data and then a series of steps to test assumptions about their potential contribution to a multi-feature linear model. In particular, we'd want to look for a set of features that exhibit a likely linear relationship with the outcome variable and that are _not_ highy correlated with each other. In the context of machine learning, these considerations remain important techniques for improving model generalizability despite the common practice to use model evaluation techniques (and large data sets) to get the final word on feature selection. \n",

    "# Question 6: Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "In question 5 we mentioned that computing the loss after each iteration is not strictly a part of Gradient Descent, it's just convenient for visualizing our progress. This \"third step\" however comes with a tradeoff: it requires an extra pass through the data. Normally this would cause us to cringe except for the fact that both the loss computation and the gradient computation are very easy to parallelize - lots of the work can be done in place with no shuffle needed for the aggregation. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)), sometimes called rotation estimation, or out-of-sample testing, is a model validation technique for assessing how well the model will generalize to an independent data set. The goal of cross-validation is to test the model's ability to predict new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation, which will solve the problem of the unreliable test-loss that we saw in question 5, presents a bit more of a scalability challenge. To avoid over-dependence on a particulary good or bad test/train split we divide the data into `k` roughly equal size parts and train `k` models. The `k-th` model is trained on all the data _except_ the `k-th` split which is used as a test set for that model. Finally we compute the loss by averaging together the test/train loss for each model. In this question we've provided a code base to perform gradient descent and cross validation in parallel. You'll fill in some of the key details based on your understanding from questions 1-5.\n",

In this naive approach, how many total passes would be made over the data? [__`HINT:`__ _it will depend on factors that you should be able to name._]\n",

For each record in the original dataset, how many tuples does `kResiduals()` emit? What are the keys of these newly emitted records?\n",

    "* __c) Short answer:__ How will these keys help us compute cross validated loss?\n",

    "* __d) code:__ Complete the missing Spark code in `CVLoss()` so that this function returns the test/train cross-validated error for a given set of data splits and their corresponding models. [__`TIP:`__ _your goal is to start from `partialLossRDD` and compute the test & train loss for each model so that the provided code can take the final average_].\n",

    "* __e) code:__ Read through the provided functions `partialGradients()` and `CVUpdate()`. These should have a familiar feel. Fill in the missing line in `CVUpdate()` to update each model and add the (new) array of coefficients to the `new_models` list. \n",

    "# Question 7: Regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal, as always, is to build a linear model that will extend well to unseen data. Chosing the right combination of features to optimize generalizability can be extremely computationally costly given that there are \\\\(2^{p}\\\\) potential models that can be built from \\\\(p\\\\) features. Traditional methods like forward selection would involve iteratively testing these options to asses which combinations of features achieve a statistically significant prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression are two popular alternatives to OLS, which enable us to train generalizable models without the trouble of forward selection and/or manual feature selection.  Both methods take advantage of the bias-variance tradeoff by _shrinking_ the model coefficients towards 0 which reduces the variance of our model with little increase in bias. In practice this 'shrinkage' is achieved by adding a penalty (a.k.a. 'regularization') term to the means squared error loss function. In this question you will implement Gradient Descent with ridge and lasso regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "__`IMPORTANT NOTE:`__ When performing regularization _do not_ include the bias in your regularization term calculation (Recall, that throughout this assignment we've included the bias at index 0 in the vector of weights that is your model).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ The regularization term for ridge regression is the square of the \\\\(L2\\\\) norm of the weights vector (i.e. the sum of squares of the coefficients) times the regularization parameter, \\\\(\\lambda\\\\). Using \\\\(\\LaTeX\\\\) in your Notebook and the **Equation Editor in Canvas**, write the formula for the loss function for Ridge Regularization.\n",

    "* __c) short response:__ The regularization term for lasso regression is the \\\\(L1\\\\) norm of the weights vector (i.e. the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients) times the regularization parameter, \\\\(\\lambda\\\\).

    "* __d) short response:__ Using \\\\(\\LaTeX\\\\) in your Notebook and the **Equation Editor in Canvas**, write the formula for the gradient for Lasso Regularization.\n",

    "\n",
    "* __f) code + short response:__ Use the provided code to train 50 iterations of ridge and lasso regression and plot the test/train error. Comment on the curves you see. Does this match your expectation?"
